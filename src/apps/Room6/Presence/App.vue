	<div class="squareoff">Presence is a kind of absence, the absence of mediation. If the users can forget that the medium is there, then they feel presence.

  To look further, Lombard and Ditton's classification of presence is useful. They grouped definitions of presence into two categories, which are
  <br>
  <br>
  <div class="keyPoint"> 
  (1) individual perception of the world
  <br>
  (2) social interaction and engagement with others</div>
  <br>
  <br>
  The first category includes presence as transportation, as immersion and as realism.
